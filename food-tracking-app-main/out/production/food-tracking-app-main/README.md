# Food Tracking App

Hey, this is a food tracking app I'm building. It has three types of users:

- **Users** - regular people who can track their calories and edit their profile
- **Nutritionists** - they can check what users are eating and add new foods to the database
- **Admins** - they manage everything, can delete users and assign people to nutritionists

Built with Java. Still working on it!
